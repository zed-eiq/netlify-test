/*
Trying to get rid of weird bloated tables and tables
Also force tables to fit screen width instead expanding to
fit all cell content in one line.

remaining issues:

-   weird 'margin-bottom:24px' 
    that I can't target and get rid off in
    the stub-column cells (``tbody>tr>th>p``)
-   because the stub-column cells have
    the weird margin-bottom:24px that we can't
    get rid of, then we have odd cell sizes
    that cause ``vertical-align`` to not kick
    in properly.
